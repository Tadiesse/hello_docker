# Puvlish images signed with a key-pair

Two points here are very important:
- First, the image is automatically built and publish every time a commit is made with the help of GitHub Actions and the workflow
- Secondly, the image is signed using a private key before being published. 

## Feature of the key-pair signing technology
To use this signing method, one must first create a key pair and then create a Cosign password in order to use the private key. This metod is a bit difficult to implement as it  requires inputs from outside GitHub. 

## How to sign one's image with the private key?
